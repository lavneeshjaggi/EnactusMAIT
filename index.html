                        A student during his education never actually learns what happens in a real life career 
                        and is never made aware of the skills and qualities required to succeed in life. This 
                        hinders a child's holistic development and forces the child to take various life 
                        affecting decisions based on his subject preferences and not career affinity. Alo brings 
                        to a child different hands-on activity based experiences of various professional fields 
                        which designed with respective experts aim to provide an authentic exposure of the career 
                        and development of real life skills specific to field. We also provide the student with a 
                        detailed assessment mapping his skill growth and career affinity.

                        Arth is a social enterprise run by students of IIT Delhi working to reduce deforestation caused by the 
                        fuelwood being used in cremations. Arth has devised a solution that goes with rituals of traditional 
                        hindu funerals. We aim to replace the fuelwood with logs made of cow dung, these logs have been modified 
                        for lower emissions. After a phase of in-depth analysis of the process of log production, we have worked 
                        on various parts. The most important among them being drying of the wet logs, major reason for not letting 
                        expansion of the idea throughout the country. Arth has come up with a drying solution that reduce the 
                        drying duration and hence not only fastens the entire process but also increases its ease.

                        This project is aimed at solving the problem of waste management in Delhi-NCR by setting up 
                        self-sustainable waste management entities through the action of decentralized waste segregation. We 
                        conduct awareness campaigns and educations session to provide knowledge to people about segregation, then 
                        we sell them our own designed composting solutions so that all the horticulture waste gets treated at 
                        home. These solutions are manufactured by small-scale manufacturers and potterers, hence making them our 
                        entrepreneurs.
